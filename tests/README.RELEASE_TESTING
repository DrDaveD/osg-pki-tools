Testing for Releases

Note that the following tests should be run, at a minimum, on Python 2.4 and
2.6. See below for details on using the FermiCloud for running 2.4 tests.

These tests are run in a source code checkout prior to making an RPM.

1) Run tests/do-tests.sh which should exit without errors. (Note this runs
   the full test suite, which will take ~10 minutes.)

2) Do 50 cert bulk issuance test.
  2a) Clear daily quota for test credential:
      https://oim-itb.grid.iu.edu/oim/contactedit?id=893
  2b) tests/do-50-cert-test.sh
  2c) Clear daily quota for test credential:
      https://oim-itb.grid.iu.edu/oim/contactedit?id=893

3) cd osgpkitools


----
Test obtaining and revoking a host certificate.

1) Do unauthenticated host certificate request:

% python ./osg-cert-request -T -n "PKI Tester" -p 555-555-5555 -e pkitester@example.com -m "Doing release testing." -t host/test.pki-test.opensciencegrid.org

And note request id number.

2) Approve request.

https://oim-itb.grid.iu.edu/oim/certificatehost?id=<id from request>

3) Retrieve the host certificate:

% python ./osg-cert-retrieve -T -i <id from request>

and check it:

% openssl x509 -in hostcert.pem -noout -text

4) Revoke the newly generated host certificate

% python ./osg-cert-revoke -T -m "Test revocation of test certificate" -i <id from request> -c hostcert.pem -k hostkey.pem

You should see a message similar to the following:

"Sucessfully revoked certificate with request ID 825"

That completes testing of host certificates with the CLI.

Testing an RPM Installation

After installing an RPM, e.g.

yum install --enablerepo=osg-development osg-pki-tools

You can run 'tests/do-tests.py -r' to test an RPM install.

This runs the scripts from /usr/bin and doesn't change PYTHONPATH or
put pki-clients.ini into the test environment (i.e. stuff that the RPM
install should be handling.)

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Setting up FermiClound system for testing

Create a VM using tests/OpenNebula/pki-cli-test.one - note you need to
change /cloud/login/vwelch/OpenNebula/k5login to use the path to your
home directory.

One the VM:

1) svn checkout https://vdt.cs.wisc.edu/svn/software/osg-cert-scripts-v3/

2) cd trunk/tests

3) sudo OpenNebula/setup-fermi-cloud.sh  # Sets up OSG RPM repos

4) sudo yum install python-pip  # Note installs pip-python instead of pip

3) sudo pip-python install scripttests unittest2  # Needed for testing

4) sudo yum install --enablerepo=osg-development python-simplejson

5) sudo yum install openssl-devel gcc python-devel  # Needed for pyton ssl

6) sudo pip-python install ssl

Now test as above.
