Test scripts for OSG Command Line Clients.

Prerequisits
============

Requires scripttest module. To install use:

    pip install scripttest

For python 2.4 and 2.6, it also requires the unittest2 module:

    pip install unittest2

You will need a set of test credentials. The certificate is in
tests/test-cert.pem and the private key may be obtained from Von Welch
(vwelch@indiana.edu). The private key must be in tests/test-key.pem

The test credentials are registered in OIM-ITB and have Grid Admin
rights in the OIM-ITB instance for pki-test.opensciencegrid.org

Test credentials registration in OIM-UTB:

To Run
======

So that the scripts can be found, the tests must be run from the
tests/ subdirectory (the directory in which this README sits):

    cd tests/
    ./do-tests.py
