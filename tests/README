Test scripts for OSG Command Line Clients.

Prerequisits
============

Requires python > 2.7 and the scripttest module. To install the latter, use:

    pip install scripttest

You need a OSG certificate (and private key) that is registered with
OIM and has Grid Admin permissions.

To Run
======

So that the scripts can be found, the tests must be run from the
tests/ subdirectory (the directory in which this README sits):

    cd test/
    ./do-tests.py

If your user cert and user key aren't in ~/.globus or pointed to by
X509_USER_CERT and X509_USER_KEY, you'll need to use -c and -p to
direct the script at them.

The script will prompt you for the passphrase for your X.509
certificate, which will be used by the tested scripts for
authentication to the OSG PKI server.
