Test scripts for OSG Command Line Clients.

Prerequisits
============

Requires python > 2.7 and the scripttest module. To install the latter, use:

    pip install scripttest

You need a OSG certificate (and private key) that is registered with
OIM and has Grid Admin permissions.

To Run
======

So that the scripts can be found, the tests must be run from the
tests/ subdirectory (the directory in which this README sits):

    cd test/
    ./do-tests.py

The script will prompt you for the passphrase for your X.509
certificate, which will be used by the tested scripts for
authentication to the OSG PKI server.
