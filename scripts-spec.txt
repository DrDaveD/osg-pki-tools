host-cert-request:  Request a host certificate

This script:
  * Generates a new host private key and CSR
    * Only important part of CSR is CN=<hostname> component
  * Saves the host private key to disk (as specified by the user)
  * Prompts the user for their private key pass phrase
  * Authenticates to OIM and posts the CSR as a request to OIM
  * Returns the request Id to the user

Inputs:
  * fully-qualified hostname
  * filename to store private key [Optional, default is ./hostkey.pem]
  * path to user's certificate [Optional, default is path specified by
    $X509_USER_CERT environment variable, ~/.globus/usercert.pem]
  * path to user's private key [Optional, default is path specified by
    $X509_USER_KEY environment variable, ~/.globus/userkey.pem]
  * Passphrase for user's private key via non-echoing prompt.

Outputs:
  * Private key, to filename specified or ./hostkey.pem
  * Request Id, to stdout

host-cert-request-guest: Request a host certificate without
authenticating to OIM

This script:
  * Generates a new host private key and CSR
    * Only important part of CSR is CN=<hostname> component
  * Saves the host private key to disk (as specified by the user)
  * Connects to OIM and posts the CSR as a request to OIM
  * Returns the request Id to the user

Inputs:
  * fully-qualified hostname
  * filename to store private key [Optional, default is ./hostkey.pem]

Outputs:
  * Private key as PEM, to filename specified or ./hostkey.pem
  * Request Id, to stdout

----------------------------------------------------------------------
cert-retrieve: Retrieve a certificate (host or user) from OIM given a
request Id. Since certificates are public, it does not authenticate to
OIM.

This script:
  * Accepts a request Id from the user
  * Connects to OIM and requests the certificate identified by the request id
  * Write the certificate to disk (as specified by the user)

Inputs:
  * Request Id
  * Filename to store certificate [Optional, default is ./hostcert.pem]

Outputs:
  * Host certificate as PEM, to filename specified or ./hostcert.pem

----------------------------------------------------------------------
multi-cert-gridadmin: Request and retrieve mutliple host certificates
from OIM. Authenticates to OIM and is only for use by Grid Admins for
certificates they are authorized to vet.

This script:
  * Reads a list of fully-qualified hostnames from a file specified by the user.
  * For reach hostname:
     * Generates a new private key and CSR
       * Only important part of CSR is CN=<hostname> component
     * Writes the private key to a file with filename:
       <prefix>/<hostname>-key.pem
  * Prompts the user for their private key pass phrase
    * Pass phrase is caches so user is not re-prompted
  * Authenticates to OIM and posts the CSRs as a single request to OIM
    * Request id is returned and subsequently used
  * Authenticates to OIM and approves the request
  * Waits one minute for request to be processed by OIM
  * Start loop:
    * Connects to OIM and attempts to retrieve certificates
      * Writes out any certificates it retrieves with filename
        of <prefix>/<hostname>-cert.pem
    * if all certificates have been retrieved, exit loop
    * Wait 5 seconds and repeat.

Inputs:
  * filename of list of hostnames
  * prefix path in which to write private keys and certificares [default: .]
  * path to user's certificate [Optional, default is path specified by
    $X509_USER_CERT environment variable, ~/.globus/usercert.pem]
  * path to user's private key [Optional, default is path specified by
    $X509_USER_KEY environment variable, ~/.globus/userkey.pem]
  * Passphrase for user's private key via non-echoing prompt.

Outputs:
  * N host certificates in PEM format
  * N private keys in PEM format
